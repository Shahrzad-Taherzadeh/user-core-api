# user-core-api
**Centralized API for User and Mobile Number Management**

A powerful and high-performance API designed for managing user identities and their associated mobile numbers. This project is implemented using the **Go Fiber** framework and leverages **Redis** as the primary data store for fast, atomic operations. The entire API is fully documented using **Swagger**.

---

## Key Features

* **Clean Architecture:** Complete separation of Model, Repository, Service, and API Handler layers to ensure high maintainability and easy scalability.
* **Redis Data Store:** Utilizes Redis as the core database (Key-Value/JSON storage) for extremely fast user CRUD operations.
* **Atomic Operations:** Implements the **Redis WATCH/TX** mechanism in the Repository layer to ensure atomic transactions when adding or deleting mobile numbers.
* **JWT Authentication:** Includes a dedicated `/login` route and a robust Fiber Middleware for validating JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Full API documentation is automatically generated by Swagger and accessible via an interactive UI.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

* **Go:** Version 1.23.4 or later.
* **Redis Server:** Must be running on `localhost:6379` (default setting in `config.yaml`).

### 2. Installation and Execution

Use the provided `Makefile` to install dependencies, generate documentation, and run the application:

| Command | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| `make deps` | Installs Go dependencies (`go mod tidy`) |
| `make swagger` | Generates the Swagger documentation files in the `docs/` folder |
| `make run` | Builds and executes the complete application |
| `make clean` | Removes build artifacts and the `docs/` folder |

### 3. Configuration

Server port, JWT secret key, and Redis connection details can be modified in the `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
  jwt_secret: "super-secret-key" 
  
redis:
  address: "localhost:6379"
